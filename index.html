I am a 5th grader who loved his 5th grade life. 5th Grade showed me what reality even is. Until 4th grade, I thought life was just rainbows and butterflies like I thought nothing could go wrong. In 5th grade, I learned that life has turning points that can be painful. I also learned that public is not always good. 5th grade was so fun, like literally, I joined like 7 competitions in one year. 5th grade was amazing.</p>

    <p>PE is very fun. You also may be wonderig what PE stands for. PE stands for Physical Education. In PE, we get to play many games and that is the main reason for everybody to wait until the time comes. In PE, we play so many games such as Normal Dodgeball, Knock-Out, Sink-The-Bismark, & Revenge-Dodgeball. These games are the most loved & popular games we ever play, especially Revenge-Dodgeball.</p>

  <p>My fourth period in school is AI which for me is GT which is the abbreviation for Gifted & Talented. I have two GT or AI teachers. My main GT teacher's name is Mrs. Cates. My alternate GT teacher is my social studies teacher, Mrs. Gonzales. GT in OIS is very energetic and crazy. We got to make a lot of creative things and almost acted out every small thing. We also had a lot of activities in computers and we were just so loud which made our school day continue very tiring. Also, you guys may be wondering that I skipped 3rd period, but 3rd period will be discussed in a separate section because PE is just so complicated.</p>

  <p>My seventh & eighth periods in school are mathematics. My mathematics teacher's name in Mr. Anderson. Mathematics in OIS is very fun. We got to do a lot a stuff like being the teacher and teaching somebody one of the topics that we learned. One of the exciting things is the Harry Potter competition. All of 5th grade was divided into 4 groups which were Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, & Hufflepuff. I was in team Slytherin. In the whole competition, Slytherin & Gryffindor were in a fierce battle. Fortunately, I caught the golden snitch which gave us a 1000 points and Team Slytherin won. We also stopped Ravenclaw's winning streak of 3 wins in a row. This was at the end of the year in April, 2023 to May, 2023. This was hosted mainly for the STAAR test practice & if you don't know what the STAAR test is, you will know now. The STAAR test is the final test of the year which starts from 3rd grade and goes on until 12th grade. The STAAR test is hosted in Texas, USA.</p>

        <p class="theultimateparagraph">Lunch is a very fun part of the schedule. You can eat lunch inside or outside the school which makes it even special. Also, in inside lunch, after 15 minutes, you can take out your phones. Now, if you want to have recess, after 15 minutes of lunch, outside or inside, you can go play. Recess is very well planned in OIS. There are 2 basketball hoops for knock-out, and 4 soccer goals. There is also a big space where we can do anything we want. That empty space is mainly used for running activities such as tag, freeze tag, infection, etc. This is what recess actually is.</p>
